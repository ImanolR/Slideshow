===========================

- Handle expanding macros is almost any place when reading a new token
	- We may have to wrap all the T.get(i) inside a method to check if the retrieved token is a macro and should be expanded

? Add scopes to prevent polution of macros across slides?

- Fullscreen mode
	
- Cursor
	- Smooth moving of the cursor
	- Maybe multiple kinds of cursors that can be toggled
		- A dot we can modigy its radius
		- An arrow that always points to a place we clicked

- Basic text format (text document)
	- @frame x y w h defines a new reference frame for the following items?
	  And all the text that gets added gets wrapped by this frame.
	  @frame_end   	
	- @Table
	
- Add animations (?):
	- A list of animation keyframes.
		- Common to all items: 
			- ItemAnimationPos
			- ItemAnimationRot
			- ItemAnimationFillColor
			- ItemAnimationOutline
		- TextItems:
			- TextItemAnimationText
				? Can we interpolate between 2 texts? or should just be a fadeout fade in?
			- TextItemAnimationFontName
				? Can we interpolate between 2 texts? or should just be a fadeout fade in?
			- TextItemAnimationFontStyle
			- TextItemAnimationAlignment
			- TextItemAnimationUndeline
			- TextItemAnimationDoubleUnderline
			- TextitemAnimationCrossed
